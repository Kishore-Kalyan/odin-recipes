    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a beloved Indian rice dish that offers a harmonious
      fusion of flavors and textures. Succulent chicken pieces, marinated in a
      blend of yogurt and aromatic spices, are layered with fragrant, long-grain
      basmati rice. The magic of this dish lies in the careful layering and slow
      cooking process. Sautéed onions, ginger, and garlic create a savory base,
      while the rice absorbs the essence of whole spices like cardamom, cloves,
      and cinnamon, along with herbs like mint and cilantro. The dish is often
      crowned with crispy fried onions and garnished with fresh cilantro and
      lemon wedges, enhancing its visual appeal and taste

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and soak 2 cups of Basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate 500 grams of chicken pieces with 1 cup of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of
        turmeric powder, 1 tablespoon of red chili powder, 1 tablespoon of
        biryani masala powder, and salt to taste. Keep it refrigerated for at
        least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat 1/2 cup of cooking oil or ghee over
        medium heat. Add 2-3 bay leaves, 4-5 green cardamom pods, 4-5 cloves, 1
        cinnamon stick, and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Sauté for a minute until
        they release their aroma.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 large thinly sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown
        and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for
        garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1-inch piece of grated ginger, and 2-3
        chopped green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw aroma
        disappears.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until it turns white and
        no longer pink. Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 cup of fresh mint leaves and 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro
        (coriander) leaves. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the soaked and drained rice over the chicken mixture in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>Pour 2 cups of water evenly over the rice.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook
        for 15-20 minutes until the rice is cooked, and the chicken is tender.
        You can also place a heavy object on the lid to seal it further.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the rice and chicken
        layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish the chicken biryani with the reserved fried onions and serve hot
        with lemon wedges.
      </li>
    </ol>
