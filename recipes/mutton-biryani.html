    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mutton biryani is a flavorful Indian rice dish that combines tender pieces
      of mutton (goat meat) marinated in a blend of spices with fragrant basmati
      rice. This aromatic dish features a medley of spices, including cardamom,
      cloves, and cinnamon, that infuse the meat and rice with rich flavors.
      Sautéed onions, ginger, and garlic create a savory base, while fresh mint
      and cilantro add a burst of freshness. Mutton biryani is often garnished
      with fried onions and served with raita for a complete and satisfying meal.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and soak 2 cups of Basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate 500 grams of mutton pieces with 1 cup of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of
        turmeric powder, 1 tablespoon of red chili powder, 1 tablespoon of
        biryani masala powder, and salt to taste. Keep it refrigerated for at
        least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat 1/2 cup of cooking oil or ghee over
        medium heat. Add 2-3 bay leaves, 4-5 green cardamom pods, 4-5 cloves, 1
        cinnamon stick, and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Sauté for a minute until
        they release their aroma.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 large thinly sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown
        and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for
        garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1-inch piece of grated ginger, and 2-3
        chopped green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw aroma
        disappears.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the marinated mutton to the pan and cook until it's browned on all
        sides. Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 cup of fresh mint leaves and 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro
        (coriander) leaves. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the soaked and drained rice over the mutton mixture in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>Pour 2 cups of water evenly over the rice.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook
        for 15-20 minutes until the rice is cooked, and the mutton is tender.
        You can also place a heavy object on the lid to seal it further.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the rice and mutton
        layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish the mutton biryani with the reserved fried onions and serve hot
        with lemon wedges.
      </li>
